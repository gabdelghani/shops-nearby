# shops-nearby
For my Web Coding Challenge, my first time with mongoDB. 

## Technologies used
- PHP 
  - Backend : Laravel 5.5
  - Frontend : Angular 
  - Database : MongoDB 3.6.2

  For Angular i used the v1.6.7, i have to learn Angular 4 to respect what you say in your Readme file but now i have a project to finish first :)

- Be careful, since 2016-2017 most browsers (in my dev machine -ubuntu 16.04 LTS- the code works with Chrome but not with firefox) ask to use the https: // protocol to access the geolocation. If you do your tests locally and / or http: // classic, the function will be disabled.

- The DB is located in /shops folder
